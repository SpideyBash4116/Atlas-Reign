NOTE: This game has started to be devoid of updates, normally because I am busy of otherstuff. I made this to test my programming skills.
Also, the old repository is for backup.

This thing is a real time country simulator that is still in alpha and not made for fun, but for testing.
I don't want to spoil anything so I won't tell you what is in the game

## Running Atlas Reign (Alpha)

Atlas Reign must be run on a local server.

1. Download or clone the repository
2. Run a local server:
   python -m http.server
3. Type localhost:XXXX and play!
